## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the Yelp Review dataset, classifying reviews into 1 to 5 stars. The analysis explores various modeling approaches, ranging from traditional machine learning baselines to deep learning architectures.

By implementing and comparing TF-IDF with Logistic Regression, Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW), and Bidirectional LSTM models, the study evaluates the effectiveness of different techniques in handling text classification tasks.

### Key Concepts Applied

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the distribution of ratings and review lengths using Altair. The dataset was found to be balanced across different rating classes.
* **Baseline Modeling**: Established a baseline using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**, achieving a Macro F1 score of **0.5936**, setting a strong benchmark for subsequent models.
* **Deep Learning Architectures**:
    * **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**: Implemented a custom CBOW model using Spacy word embeddings.
    * **Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)**: Constructed a Bi-LSTM model to capture sequential dependencies in the text. The model outperformed the CBOW approach, achieving a Validation F1 score of approximately **0.557**.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted experiments with different architectures (e.g., varying hidden sizes and number of layers) to optimize the LSTM model performance.
