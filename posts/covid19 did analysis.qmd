## Project Overview

This project estimates the early policy effects on COVID-19 transmission and damages through four dependent variables: daily new cases, cumulative cases, daily deaths, and cumulative deaths. The data is provided by the World Health Organization and Our World in Data.

Two different Difference-in-Difference models were implemented to estimate the effects of Mandatory policies, Optional policies, and no-control policies. The analysis found that mandatory policies had the most significant impact on limiting and decreasing COVID-19 transmission and damages, followed by optional policies, while no-control policies were the least effective.

### Key Concepts Applied

* **Difference-in-Difference (DiD)**: Utilized DiD models to compare the impact of different policy stringency levels on infection and death rates over time.
* **Policy Categorization**: Countries were categorized into three groups based on early policy stringency:
    * **Mandatory Countries** (e.g., China): Strict travel restrictions and enforced preventive measures.
    * **Optional Countries** (e.g., Canada, Japan, UK): Advised but not strictly enforced measures.
    * **No-control Countries** (e.g., USA, India): Limited restrictions and guidance.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzed the effects on new cases, cumulative cases, new deaths, and cumulative deaths using empiricial statistical methods.
