## Project Overview

This project focuses on quantifying factors influencing Chinese farmers' decisions to purchase weather insurance and predicting their purchasing probabilities. Using a dataset from Jiangxi, China, which includes 4,902 observations and 59 variables[cite: 30], the study navigates the challenges of predicting human economic behavior in a low-dimensional setting.

By implementing Lasso Cross-Validation and Random Forest algorithms, the project contrasts linear regularization methods with non-linear tree-based methods to identify significant determinants such as "Understanding" and "Social Network".

### Key Concepts Applied

* **Variable Selection with Lasso**: Utilized Lasso regularization to handle the bias-variance trade-off. The optimal $\lambda$ zeroed out 14 regressors, highlighting "Understanding" and "Network-related" variables as the most significant predictors.
* **Ensemble Learning (Random Forest)**: Constructed a Random Forest model with 300 trees to capture non-linear relationships. Results revealed that unlike in the Lasso model, "Age" played a considerable role in purchasing decisions, while "Risk Averse" traits were surprisingly less important.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated models using ROC Curves, Sensitivity/Specificity trade-offs, and $R^2$. While the Lasso model achieved ~64% prediction correctness, the low $R^2$ (< 0.1) across both models highlighted the complexity of behavioral prediction and potential unobserved variables.
* **Data Cleaning & Bias Analysis**: Processed raw data by handling NA values and removing variables with >1000 missing entries. Conducted a critical analysis of data limitations, acknowledging potential biases from omitted variables like modern technology adoption.
