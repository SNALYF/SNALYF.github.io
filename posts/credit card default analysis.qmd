## Project Overview

A project of credit card default analysis and corresponding prediction. 

[https://github.com/SNALYF/Credit-Card-Default-Analysis](URL)

### Key Concepts Applied
* **EDA**: Cleaned and implemented EDA to dataset, navigated on the correlations between numerical features and categorical features
* **Model Selection**: Conducted logistic model (Test F1-score: 0.530), SVC model (Test F1-score: 0.532), HistGradientBoosting (0.534), and XGBoosting model(0.507).
* **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implemented Randomized Search Cross-Validation on SVC, HistGradientBoosting, and XGBoosting model to obtain the highest F1-score.
* **Shap Interpretation**: Analyzed SHAP plot to interpret black-box model decisions, identified most important feature.
