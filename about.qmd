## My Journey

I am currently a master's student at the **University of British Columbia (UBC)**, majoring in **Data Science, Computational Linguistics**.

My academic journey is driven by a fascination with *patterns*—whether they are hidden in large datasets, embedded in human language, or structured within musical compositions.

## Technical Philosophy

I don't just "run code." I believe in understanding the mathematical foundations behind the algorithms.

* **In Data Science**: My background in Statistics and Computer Science allows me to deeply understand model behaviors, rather than being only a user of black-box models.
* **In Economics**: My background in microeconomics and macroeconomics allows me to combine Economic theories with Data Science.

## Experience & Mentorship

**Mentoring Program** | Mentee
*Working with Jacob Oh (Jan 2026 - Present)*
Participating in a professional mentorship program to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry application. Focusing on career development in tech and software engineering best practices.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not coding in Python or analyzing data, I am likely exploring **Music Theory**.
I am fascinated by how chords and scales function mathematically. This hobby actually complements my coding work, as both require recognizing structures and creative problem-solving within a set of rules.
